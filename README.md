# Project-00
In this project i have created a my personal website 
## Techonologies i have used :
```
    Html5
    css
    jQuery
    javascript

```

## Process/Approach :
Before starting coding i made all wireframe of the design and after that I started  codeing for bigger screen size, above 1100px at max, contuning along with the small size.
![Main Page wireframe](wireframe.png| width = 300 )
<img src="wireframe.png" width="300">
I used mozilla, web developer > responsive desing mode,  tool to check the effect on website depending to changes in screen width. wherever any undesired changes occured in the webiste i used another css rules
for that particular screen size. For instance
```
@media (max-width: 756px) {
    //
    //
 }
```
